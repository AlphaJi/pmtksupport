This site contains 'snapshots' of [various code packages](http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/packageAuthors.html) (mostly in Matlab, and mostly related to machine learning) that are used by [PMTK](http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/). Consequently, this is meant to be a read-only site. If you want to change some code, it is best to email the original authors with your request, or make your own local copy with a different name. However, we have made some very minor changes in some cases to ensure compatibility and inter-operability: see [here](http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/wiki/compatibility) for details of these changes.

We created this repository for several reasons, including

  * PMTK users only need to download supporting code from this one site.

  * If the original code disappears or changes, PMTK will continue to work.

  * Having a repository that is separate from PMTK makes it clearer who wrote what code, and allows different license types to be mixed. It also reduces the size of the PMTK core package.

  * This site does not need to be updated as often as PMTK.
