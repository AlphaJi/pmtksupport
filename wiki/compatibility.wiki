Below we list (in)compatibilities between different packages and pmtk/ matlab,
and steps taken to resolve these. (These constitute changes to the source packages which will need to be repeated if a new version of these packages is installed.)

 * markSchmidt/misc/sampleDiscrete has different interface to pmtk's sampleDiscrete. His code assumes N=1, whereas pmtk lets you draw multiple samples. It has been removed.

 *  we do not call install_lightspeed.m as this shadows a number of built in functions, instead we use installLightspeedPMTK.m.

 *  lightspeed2.3\randgamma.m - original version just errors if randgamma.mex is not found. The change is to add this line instead: {{{x = randg(a);}}}. randg is a stats toolbox function that also exists in Octave. It has the same interface as randgamma. 

 *  lightspeed2.3\gammaln.mexw32 shadows built-in function. It has been removed.

 * lightspeed2.3\normpdf.m shadows built-in function. it has been renamed normpdfLightspeed.

 * lighspeed2.3\rows  aliases built-in Octave 'rows' function causing subtle errors. It has been renamed to rowsLightspeed.

 * libsvm-mat-2.9.1\svmtrain.c and libsvm-mat-2.9.1\svmtrain.mex32 are aliased by the bioinformatics toolbox svmtrain.m function. These have been renamed libsvmTrain.c and libsvmTrain.mex32. 

 * gpml-matlab - removed solve_chol.c which does not compile. There is a .m version.




=== general notes ===

  * Many external packages have {{{.mex*}}} files, which may have to be regenerated under various operating systems if a package is updated.
