Below we list (in)compatibilities between different packages and pmtk/ matlab,
and steps taken to resolve these. (These constitute changes to the source packages which will need to be repeated if a new version of these packages is installed.)

 * markSchmidt/misc/sampleDiscrete has different interface to pmtk's sampleDiscrete. His code assumes N=1, whereas pmtk lets you draw multiple samples. It has been removed.

 *  lightspeed2.3\gammaln.mexw32 shadows built-in function. It has been removed.

 * lightspeed2.3\normpdf.m shadows built-in function. it has been renamed normpdfLightspeed.

 * lighspeed2.3\rows  aliases built-in Octave 'rows' function causing subtle errors. It has been renamed to rowsLightspeed.

 * libsvm-mat-2.9.1\svmtrain.c and libsvm-mat-2.9.1\svmtrain.mex32 are aliased by the bioinformatics toolbox svmtrain.m function. These have been renamed libsvmTrain.c and libsvmTrain.mex32.
