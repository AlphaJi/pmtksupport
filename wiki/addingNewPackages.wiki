#summary instructions on adding new packages

== Adding a new Package ==

  * Create new directory, say 'foopack, for the package. Create a file called "foopack-readme.txt". This file should have PMTKtitle, PMTKauthor, PMTKurl, and PMTKdate [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/PMTKtags tags]. Follow [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/browse/trunk/graphViz4Matlab/graphViz4Matlab-readme.txt this] as  example.

  * Check [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/wiki/compatibility this list] for changes you need to make to ensure the package 'plays nicely' with other pmtk packages on the path.

  * Check the package into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository]. It must live in its own subdirectory.

  * Run this PMTK command: `refreshZipFiles('support', 'foopack')`. This will download the files to a local directory, and create a zip file out of them.

  * Check the zip file into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository].

  * Update the online list of packages by running [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pmtkTools/supportTools/generateSupportReport.m generateSupportReport]. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/updatingDocumentation here] for details.
 
  * Test auto-downloading by running [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pmtkTools/supportTools/downloadAllSupport.m downloadAllSupport], which will download and unzip the packages to the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/external external] directory.

  * Make sure the new package hasn't shadowed existing files by running 
[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/matlabTools/metaTools/shadowedFilesReport.m shadowedFilesReport]
