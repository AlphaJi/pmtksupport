#summary instructions on adding new packages

== Adding a new Package ==

  # Check the package into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository]. It must live in its own subdirectory. Suppose this directory is called "foopack".
  # [compatibility Document] any compatibility changes made.
  # Create a file called "foopack-meta.m" in the [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/meta/ pmtkSupport/meta] directory.
  # Add PMTKtitle, PMTKauthor, PMTKurl, and PMTKdate [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/PMTKtags tags] to this file. Follow [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/browse/trunk/meta/graphViz4Matlab-meta.m this] as an example.
  # Check the meta file into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository].
  # Run this PMTK command to zip up the new package: `refreshZipFiles('support', 'foopack')`. 
  # Check the zip file into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository].
  # Update the online list of packages by running [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/docTools/generateSupportReport.m generateSupportReport]. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/updatingDocumentation here] for details. 
  # Test auto-downloading by running [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/downloadAllSupport.m downloadAllSupport], which will download and unzip the packages to the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/external external] directory.
  # Make sure the new package hasn't shadowed existing files by running {{{shadowedFilesReport}}}.
