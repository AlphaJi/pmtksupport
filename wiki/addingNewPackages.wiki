#summary instructions on adding new packages

== Adding a new Package ==

  # Create new directory, say 'foopack, for the package. Create a file called "foopack-readme.txt". This file should have PMTKtitle, PMTKauthor, PMTKurl, and PMTKdate [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/PMTKtags tags]. Follow [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/browse/trunk/graphViz4Matlab-readme.txt this] as  example.

  # Check the package into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository]. It must live in its own subdirectory.

  # Run this PMTK command: `refreshZipFiles('support', 'foopack')`. This will download the files to a local directory, and create a zip file out of them.

  # Check the zip file into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository].

  # Update the online list of packages by running [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/docTools/generateSupportReport.m generateSupportReport]. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/updatingDocumentation here] for details. 

  # Test auto-downloading by running [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/downloadAllSupport.m downloadAllSupport], which will download and unzip the packages to the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/external external] directory.
  # Make sure the new package hasn't shadowed existing files by running {{{shadowedFilesReport}}}.

== Updating a Package ==

To update a package, follow the same steps as above, but be sure to check [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/wiki/compatibility this list] for compatibility changes you will need to manually redo.
