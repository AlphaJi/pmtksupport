#summary instructions on adding new packages

== Adding a new Package ==

  # Check the package into the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository]. It must live in its own subdirectory. Suppose this directory is called "foopack".
  # Create a file called "foopack-meta.m" in the [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/meta/ pmtkSupport/meta] directory.
  # Add PMTKtitle, PMTKauthor, PMTKurl, and PMTKdate [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/PMTKtags tags] to this file. Follow [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/browse/trunk/meta/graphViz4Matlab-meta.m this] as an example.
  # Add a new [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/downloads/list pmtkSupport*.zip download] via e.g. [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/docTools/exportToGoogleCode.m exportToGoogleCode.m]. This file must be up to date for pmtkSupport auto-downloading to work. 
  # Modify the link to this new zip file in the PMTK3 [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file, under the PMTKsupportLink property. Again, this is needed for auto-downloading. 
  # Update the online list of packages by running [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/docTools/generateSupportReport.m generateSupportReport.m]. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/updatingDocumentation here] for details. 
  # Test auto-downloading by removing the contents of pmtk3/external and running [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3.m].

== Updating a new Package ==

To update a package, follow the same steps as above, but be sure to check [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/wiki/compatibility this list] for compatibility you will need to manually redo.
