Below we list (in)compatibilities between different packages and pmtk/ matlab,
and steps taken to resolve these. (These constitute changes to the source packages which will need to be repeated if a new version of these packages is installed.)

 * markSchmidt/misc/sampleDiscrete has different interface to pmtk's sampleDiscrete. His code assumes N=1, whereas pmtk lets you draw multiple samples.

 *  lightspeed2.3\gammaln.mexw32 shadows built-in function, and has been removed.

 * lightspeed2.3\normpdf.m shadows built-in function, and has been removed.
